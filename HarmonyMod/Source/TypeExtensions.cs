 * IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
 * 
 * This file contains leftover code from the initial fork from Felix Schmidt's
 * repository https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony
 * 
 * It contains known bad code, which is either not used at all in my implementation,
 * or it is in the course of being re-written. If I am rewriting it, I only included
 * it because an initial release of my project was needed urgently to address
 * a broken modding eco-system in Cities Skylines, and I considered it will do no
 * further harm over what has already been done by Felix Schmidt's code.
 * 
 * I would recommend you do not copy or rely on this code. A near future update will
 * remove this and replace it with proper code I would be proud to put my name on.
 * 
 * Until then, the copyright notice above was expressely requested by Felix Schmidt,
 * by means of a DMCA complaint at GitHub and Steam.
 * 
 * There is no code between the end of this comment and he "END-OF-Felix Schmidt-COPYRIGHT"
 * line if there is one, or the end of the file, that I, Radu Hociung, claim any copyright
 * on. The rest of the content, outside of these delimiters, is my copyright, and
 * you may copy it in accordance to the modified GPL license at the root or the repo
 * (LICENSE file)
 * 
 * FUTHER, if you base your code on a copy of the example mod from Felix Schmidt's
 * repository, which does not include his copyright notice, you will likely also
 * be a victim of DMCA complaint from him.
